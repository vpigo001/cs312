                <span class="game">Super Smash Bros.: Melee</span> is a fighting-style video game for the 
                Nintendo Gamecube released on November 21, 2001. 
                Originally intended to be a party game, Melee was quickly taken toward a competitive direction 
                by its players.
                Hundreds of advanced tactics have been discovered over the years, and the competition is 
                faster, stronger, 
                and more ruthless than ever. For more information on the history of the game and its players, 
                please see the Super Smash Bros.: Melee documentary created by Samox

            finish at Apex and a 9th place finish at Revival of Melee.  
            Ether has helped grow the melee community in SoVa for years and is currently on a hiatus while 
            he works to finish his degree in Computer Science.
