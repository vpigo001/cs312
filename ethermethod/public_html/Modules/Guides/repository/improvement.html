                <p>This guide will explain the exact steps to get at least as good as I am.&nbsp; If you pool my knowledge with your knowledge, you should be better than I am.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Early steps:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Play a high/top tier character.&nbsp; Preferably the character that the current best in the world plays. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Do nothing but watch vids of this pro.&nbsp; Spend hours each day. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Wake up in the morning, watch vids.&nbsp; Before you go to sleep, too.</p>
                <p>*You're looking to commit to your subconscious memory actions that won't make sense until much later.</p>
                <p>*Still, try to spot a few combos that the pro does.&nbsp; Pick a few that are varied and commit them to memory. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp; Varied:&nbsp; One that's short, but quick and easy damage, one that's several hits long, one that's really long and complicated</p>
                <p>*Spot at least 2-3 combos that lead to guaranteed death.</p>
                <p>*So far, you haven't even touched the controller.</p>
                <p>*Find a rival.&nbsp; Find someone who makes your blood boil every time they take your stock.</p>
                <p>*Stop playing your friends.&nbsp; They're only going to bring you down. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Understand that your greatest opponent will be yourself.&nbsp; You are going to become the greatest player in the world, so start hating your current self.</p>
                <p>*Almost ready to pick up the sticks.&nbsp; But not yet.</p>
                <p>*START READING.&nbsp; This will get you started:</p>
                <p>&nbsp; Compendium of SSBM Knowledge (gamefaqs): http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/516492-super-smash-bros-melee/37242284</p>
                <p>*^The above link will teach you just about every term in the game.&nbsp; Some of them will open your mind to new and exciting worlds.</p>
                <p>&nbsp; Didn't know there were freezing glitches or double jump cancels?&nbsp; You will, now. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Tech training:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Pick up the controller.</p>
                <p>*Training mode.&nbsp; You heard me.&nbsp; No C-Stick.</p>
                <p>*Learn to short hop with the stick.&nbsp; If you picked a character with a fast jump, like Fox or Sheik, sorry.&nbsp; But you'll be that much better when it's over.</p>
                <p>*This is hard.&nbsp; I know it is.&nbsp; Dry your tears, or lick them.</p>
                <p>*It's not about how hard you flick the stick.&nbsp; It's about how long the stick is held "up".&nbsp; Graze it with your thumb.&nbsp; You'll want to tap it like you're</p>
                <p>&nbsp; touching a hot stove.</p>
                <p>*Short hop up, up-right, up-left.&nbsp; Short hop from one side of the stage to the other, and then back, like swimming laps at a pool.&nbsp; Do these in sets of 10.</p>
                <p>&nbsp; If you make a mistake, you have to start your 10 sets all over again.</p>
                <p>*Feeling frustrated?&nbsp; Feel like throwing your controller at the wall?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; You make a decision right now to get this right.&nbsp; At some point in the future,</p>
                <p>&nbsp; you've already mastered this.&nbsp; At some point, you've figured out the secrets.&nbsp; All you have to do is figure out what you've already learned.</p>
                <p>*DO NOT play anybody.&nbsp; Stop playing. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>*You've mastered the short hop.&nbsp; Or so you think. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Shffl your aerials.&nbsp; Short hop, aerial, fast fall, l-cancel.&nbsp; Use the stick for all of this.</p>
                <p>&nbsp; Shffl tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G4XNiCY2Kw</p>
                <p>*Shffl each aerial in sets of 30, starting over if you make a mistake.&nbsp; Do this multiple times per day.</p>
                <p>*Getting the jist of it, but not fluent.&nbsp; I know.</p>
                <p>*Turn off the game.&nbsp; Unplug your controller.&nbsp; Visualize the shffl and do the motions on the controller.&nbsp; Learn what it feels like to make a mistake on the</p>
                <p>shffl.</p>
                <p>*Do this for 30-60 min each day.&nbsp; Occassionally, turn on the tv to sometime funny while you practice the motions.&nbsp; You'll learn to associate muscle</p>
                <p>&nbsp; memory with happiness instead of frustration.</p>
                <p>*Go back to the game and practice shffling in training mode again.&nbsp; It'll feel clunky at first.&nbsp; You'll doubt that you've learned anything.&nbsp; That's not true.</p>
                <p>*Eventually, you'll feel you've gotten it.&nbsp; Start hitting the cpu in training mode by linking together shuffl'd moves.&nbsp; Try to raise that combo count.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Tech training extended:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Repeat the whole last section, using the X or Y button to jump.</p>
                <p>*Repeat the whole last section by going to Versus mode, plugging in a second controller so you don't have to fight a level 1 cpu, and then use the</p>
                <p>&nbsp; C-stick for your aerials.</p>
                <p>*You jump farther horizontally with the X or Y buttons than you do with the control stick.&nbsp; And using the C-stick for your aerials lets you move in</p>
                <p>&nbsp; one direction while attacking in another. (jumping left while fairing right, for instance).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Wavedashing:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Learn to do it first with the stick, then with X or Y.</p>
                <p>*Laps across the stage, sets of 10.&nbsp; Repeat if you mess up.</p>
                <p>*Tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n4s5yB7ZkE (it's the advanced how to play series, watch all four parts)</p>
                <p>*It's easier to do with X or Y than with the stick, because you can DI down-right and then hit Y-&gt;R, instead of flicking the stick up then down-right,</p>
                <p>&nbsp; then R.&nbsp; But be adamant about learning to do it with the stick.</p>
                <p>*Feel free to use L to wavedash or shffl, I don't care.</p>
                <p>*Learn to wavedash out of shield.&nbsp; You can jump out of shield, so you can wavedash out of shield.</p>
                <p>*Do laps around the stage: shield-&gt;wavedash, shield-&gt;wavedash, both with stick and X/Y.</p>
                <p>*also called waveshielding or more commoning shield dashing.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Edge games:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Short hop to the edge for edgehog.&nbsp; Use the stick, then use X/Y.&nbsp; Sets of 30.&nbsp; That's implied by now, so I'll stop saying it.</p>
                <p>*Learn to wavedash to the edge for edgehog.&nbsp; Tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n492FsqgmmQ</p>
                <p>*You can fast fall on your way to edgehog to get there faster.&nbsp; Make sure not to fast fall too far, or you'll miss the ledge.</p>
                <p>*Don't wavedash to the edge if you're too close to the edge.&nbsp; You'll most likely airdodge off the stage to your death (also called Azen-dashing, maybe</p>
                <p>&nbsp; bobacking).</p>
                <p>*You're invincible when you grab the ledge for exactly 60 frames, or 1 second.&nbsp; You're invincible upon respawn for exactly 120 frames, or 2 seconds.</p>
                <p>*You can grab the edge and roll, and you'll edgehog.&nbsp; You probably know this.&nbsp; If you don't, look it up in the compendium.</p>
                <p>*You can ledgehop.&nbsp; Let go of the edge and then use your midair jump to jump back onstage.</p>
                <p>*You can let go of the edge by either pressing away from the ledge or pressing down.</p>
                <p>*It's easier to ledgehop if you press away, because pressing down will make you fast fall, and you'll be less likely to make it back onstage with your</p>
                <p>&nbsp; midair jump.</p>
                <p>*Some characters with large midair jumps benefit from ledgehopping by pressing down; otherwise, you'll jump too high back onto stage.</p>
                <p>*Practice ledgehopping all your aerials.&nbsp; You know the drill...sets.</p>
                <p>*Some of your aerials may have so little lag that you can let go of the ledge, jump straight up (instead of onto the stage), do the aerial, and regrab the</p>
                <p>&nbsp; ledge.&nbsp; Learn these.</p>
                <p>*Learn to waveland.&nbsp; I can't find a good tutorial for this, but the vid Triforce of Power comes to mind. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Be able to waveland off the edge and then jump back onto stage, and repeat in a loop.&nbsp; Do sets.&nbsp; See me if you need clarification.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Combos:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Link together moves with hitstun. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Start trying to learn those combos you memorized your favorite pro doing.&nbsp; Sets.</p>
                <p>*Definitely learn how to do combos that result in K.O., no matter how short or long.&nbsp; Start learning percents at which they work.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Middle Steps:</p>
                <p>*Finally, play your friends.&nbsp; Win easily.&nbsp; Or...</p>
                <p>*Lose horribly.&nbsp; There's more to smash than just tech skill, and if you didn't think so, you're dead wrong.</p>
                <p>*Memorize each moment you get hit.&nbsp; Figure out what you were trying to do, and then figure out how they knew you were going to do it.</p>
                <p>*Play people a little worse than you are.&nbsp; Get better at comboing them.</p>
                <p>*Play people a little better than you are.&nbsp; Start memorizing their patterns.</p>
                <p>*Get used to 4-stocking weaker opponents, using mostly tech skill probably.</p>
                <p>*Record vids.&nbsp; Try to see what you're doing wrong, or how you're being too predictable. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Rewatch those same vids of your favorite pro.&nbsp; Realize you understand a lot more of what's going on.</p>
                <p>*Realize you still know nothing about this game. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The Juggle:</p>
                <p>*Stop playing your friends.</p>
                <p>*Play against level 5 cpus.&nbsp; Spend your time trying to keep them in the air no matter what.</p>
                <p>*Play with a friend against one level 5 (never level 9!)</p>
                <p>*Try to juggle the cpu between the two of you.</p>
                <p>*Do this for hours, and for once, have fun.&nbsp; Throw in items if you want to.</p>
                <p>*There will come a time when your opponent is good, and you can't combo.&nbsp; When all else fails, juggle.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The Intricacies of Your Character:</p>
                <p>*Figure them out.&nbsp; Use the compendium.</p>
                <p>*Even better, use Smashboards, in the Character-Specific section.</p>
                <p>*Learn your advanced recovery tricks, edgeguarding tricks, and better combos.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Develop your mind:</p>
                <p>*Start talking to pros online.</p>
                <p>*Don't get cocky, but never put yourself down saying, "Oh, I'm nowhere near as good as you are," or "I suck so bad at this game."</p>
                <p>*Dream about this game.</p>
                <p>*Read Sun Tzu's Art of War.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Learn to Dodge:</p>
                <p>*Play against competent people.</p>
                <p>*Turn on Time.</p>
                <p>*Spend one minute running around trying to dodge.&nbsp; You cannot attack.</p>
                <p>*Switch roles after one minute.</p>
                <p>*Winner after 8 minutes is the one with the most stocks/least amount of damage, as usual.</p>
                <p>*Throw in items.&nbsp; Give yourself more to dodge.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Go to your first tourney.</p>
