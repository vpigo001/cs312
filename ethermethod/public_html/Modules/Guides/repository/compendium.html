Everybody always asking, “What does _____ mean?” Well, you should never ask that knowing that there is this huge list. And this time, it’s all in alphabetical order. (ycz6 version only: This particular section steals just a tad from AlphaZealot's updated Compendium at smashboards.com. Sorry. Hope you don't mind. Also, I wrote the quotes. Some are probably incorrect.)

Air Dodge- L or R in the air results in an air dodge. Until a character lands after an air dodge, he cannot do any attacks or jump, like after most recovery attacks. You can also influence the direction of an air dodge with the control stick. Air dodges can be used as an “extra jump” for characters without a good up-b (Yoshi, Jigglypuff, etc) “He tried to airdodge my f-smash, but I saw it coming and grabbed him instead.”

Attack- The A, B, and Z buttons, along with the C-stick all make your character do an attack. The B button is for special moves, and the rest control standard attacks. The C-stick performs an uncharged smash when used on the ground and performs aerials when used in the air. It can only be used in versus modes. Also, the Z button is only an attack when used in the air. Samus, Link, and Young Link do not do attacks with the Z button, instead they shoot their respective grappling items when in the air. “Many of Ganondorf’s attacks do considerable damage.”

Bat drop- In the Home Run Contest, pressing Z to drop the bat, followed by an attack that prevents it from flying off the platform, most often a spike. By doing this you are giving a lot of damage in a short amount of time. This is the technique most commonly used to get high scores in Home Run Contest. Abbreviated as bd. “At world record speed, Mr. Game and Watch can do ten bat drops before going a Judgment 9; however, doing nine bd ADAs into a bd J9 goes further.”

Bomb jump- Samus and Link can both bomb jump, but in different ways. With Samus, if you use a bomb in midair, drop, and use another bomb, you'll bounce into the explosion of the first bomb and bounce again. You can repeat this for as long as you like giving Samus great horizontal recovery. With Link, when he is recovering you have to pull out a bomb, as you use your second jump, then throw it up, Up-B into the bomb, and then use Up-B again after the bomb hits you. The result is one jump but two Up-B’s. “Samus’ bomb jump allows her to go completely under many stages, including Corneria and Final Destination.”

BtT- Short for Break the Targets; that is, Target Test. “I’m trying to get my BtT total under four minutes.”

BYOC- Short for Bring Your Own Controller. A common rule at tournaments. “I forgot about BYOC and had to borrow a spare from my crewmate.”

Camping- Sitting in one spot and not letting the opponent get close enough to attack you. It’s a method of delaying a kill, most often used in an effort to stall out a match. Projectiles are usually used to help keep the opponent from landing attacks. “He camped me for two stocks, then broke out an incredible combo for the third.”

Cancel- From the air, many characters can cancel attacks or effects of attacks- usually lag- by doing an attack close to the ground. Some examples are:
Peach's Float cancel- Start an aerial attack while floating, and land while still doing the attack. There will be no lag from the attack. 
Samus' Missile cancel- The missile will fire, but there will be no lag from it, and Samus will be able to move instantly. Alternatively, the missile (forward-B) will still make a sound, but no projectile will be fired. 
Falco's Laser cancel- see above (Except use B attack) 
Sheik's Needle cancel- you get the idea
“You can cancel Jigglypuff’s Sing on the edge to remove lag, then combo into a rest.”

Chainthrow- Repeatedly throwing another character in such a manner as to prevent them from landing. They can’t escape during the chain, allowing you to continue to rack up damage. Eventually, the characters damage will be so high that the throw sends them out of your reach. And for a little more about chain-throws: 
- Mr. G&W is the only character that is capable of chain throwing with all directions.
Some common chains are:
Marth - Up against fastfallers
Ganon - D-throw
Sheik- D-throw
“He tried to chainthrow me, but I got out at 30% and managed a nice edgeguard for the win.”

Combo- Technically short for "combonation", but nobody says that anymore. A combo can be either natural or improvisational; a true combo is two or more hits that register a 'Combo' reading in training mode. Basically, though, a combo is any set of attacks that is difficult to escape from if the first attack hits, and does a lot of damage in a short amount of time. Combos can often be ruined by good DI (see the section below on Directional Influence). “It seemed like he was trying to imitate Ken, but his combos never landed and he lost quickly.”

Crews and Crew Battles- Groups of people who Smash together usually form a crew. Crews are usually unique to a region or location within a region. An offshoot of crews is the concept of a crew battle, where two crews delegate stocks to each member of the crew and subsequently fight until one crew loses all stock. “The East Coast vs. West Coast crew matches are always intense. The strategy is surprisingly deep.”

Crouch-canceling- Holding down on the control stick when hit by an enemy attack. Up to a certain damage percentage, this will prevent you from being sent flying, though you will slide back. Abbreviated as CC. Also, a crouch cancel counter (CCC) is crouch canceling followed by a retaliatory attack. Do not confuse with Dash-canceling. This has recently been discovered to be an effect of Smash DI; see the section below on DI. “I crouch-canceled his aerial into a CCC f-smash.”

C-Sticking- C-sticking is just a name used to describe the act of using the c-stick to do aerials, smash attacks, and other things. This does not work in any 1-player mode. “I find it easier to shffl u-airs by c-sticking.”

Damage- Each character in a fight has a counter of his own at the bottom of the screen that tallies his health in points, displayed as a percentage. At the lowest percentage (0%) attacks will not send your character very far, and effects like Jigglypuff's sing are easy to shake off. Grabs become harder to get out of at higher damages, and attacks send you much farther. “I survived to over 200% damage with good DI and techs.”

Dash-canceling- During a run, pressing down will cause you to crouch and therefore stop the run without experiencing the lag of the dash-stop animation. “He shielded my dash-canceled f-smash, then followed into a wavegrab.”

Dashdancing- Quickly smashing left and right on the control stick, so the character does the opening animation of the run in both directions, usually in place. Used as a fake-out tactic of sorts. “His dashdancing completely threw me off. I couldn’t land a single grab on him.”

Dash grab- see grab/throw.

Dash-jump- Jumping out of a dash, often with a short jump. The character will usually move faster forward in the air than if it were a non-dash-jump. The three characters that don't move any faster either way are Jigglypuff, Bowser, and Zelda. “The dash-jump after target 4 in the Fox BtT WR strategy throws me off sometimes.”

Desynching- Staggering the Ice Climbers’ actions to have them perform actions independently of each other. “IC dittos are crazy. The desynching makes them seem like 2 vs. 2 battles.” See http://www.smashboards.com/showthread.php?t=53912

Disjointed Hitbox- Every character has a hitbox for every attack. Any attack will hit everybody within a certain area, its hitbox. When a hitbox is not attached to the character, such as in Marth/Roy/Link/Young Link's sword attacks and Ness's bat smash, its called a disjointed hitbox. A sword and a leg (such as Captain Falcon's) are going to be affected differently by fire. The character whose knee comes in contact with the fire is going to get hit, but the character with the sword is not, since damage to the weapon (a disjointed hitbox) does not affect the character. See hitbox. "Marth's disjointed hitbox allows him to control small stages such as Battlefield and Yoshi's Story incredibly well."

Double Jump cancel- Basically, you can stop the upward motion of Mewtwo, Ness, Peach, or Yoshi's second jump with an aerial attack. For example, if Ness does two jumps in short succession, followed by a quick aerial attack, he should be VERY low to the ground. This is useful for combos and mind games. Double Jump cancel is abbreviated "DJC." The term DJCFFL, an improved version of the SHFFL using the Double Jump Cancel, is sometimes used, but the fastfall and l-cancel are usually assumed. "Wow, Fumi's DJCing is crazy. Are you sure Yoshi isn't top tier?"

Edge/Ledge-guarding- Attacking the enemy as he/she is recovering to prevent them from making it back onto the stage. "Ken may be the best edgeguarder in the country."

Edge/Ledge-hogging- Only one character at a time can hold onto an edge. So if you are on the edge, your opponent can't be. This is useful in preventing an enemy's recovery. The best way to edge-hog is to either wavedash or short-jump backwards onto the ledge. "I edgehogged him, and his teammate spiked me off the edge."

Edge/Ledge-hop- A jump quickly following a press of down or away from an edge-hang will let characters do a short edge-hop. All characters can do attacks out of this, though some are rather short. "The edge-hopped counter, as Marth, can throw off your opponents completely."

Extended Grappling Beam (Samus)- Hit Z. Keep pressing Z, and at the same time, alternate up and down on the d-pad a few times. The exact button presses required are Z, up, down, up, Z. The grappling beam should now go much farther, and if you hold L while using it, you can target the nearest player to you. To grab, press A when the tip of the beam is over an opponent. "Wes's use of the extended grapple in the FC3 crew matches got a rather interesting response from certain members of the crowd."

Fastfalling- Pressing down while in the air will make your character fall faster than usual. You can fast-fall any time you are falling after the peak of your jump. "I'm trying to learn how to fastfall during bat drops as Captain Falcon."

Fox's infinite combo- Short hop drill kick L-cancelled into a waveshine (reflector (down-B), then wavedash out of it), followed by a short hop drill kick, L-cancelled into a waveshine, etc., etc.. Very hard to do, even on the slower speeds of training mode without considerable practice. This only works on certain characters. "MoFo is notorious for his training mode videos of the infinite combo on several characters."

Foxtrot- Dashing then stopping over and over again, causing the character to only do the opening animation of the run. For some characters, this is faster than just running. "Foxtrotting can be an effective mix-up tactic when combined with wavedashing and dashdancing."

Frame- A term used in videography and game design to describe each individual picture, which when put together make video. SSBM runs at 60 frames per second, so one frame is one 60th of a second. "Ganondorf's neutral-A comes out in one frame, which makes it as fast as the Shine and Rest."

Freezing glitches- 
Ice Climbers: Roll behind the enemy using the L or R shield. Halfway before the roll is over, start holding Z, and the second Climber MUST grab the enemy. Do a forward B in the direction you just rolled from and if it worked, the enemy should be frozen after Nana (second IC) throws him/her/it. This glitch only works on NTSC versions.
Mewtwo: Throw a red shell, then use Confusion (forward-B) to reflect it five times. After the fifth time, have your opponent stand directly in front of you. Use confusion once more immediately before the red shell hits. You should hear the shield break sound clip, and your opponent will now be stuck to you. If you throw another opponent, they will be frozen in midair. This glitch is known as the Soul Breaker, and the freezing is known as the Soul Stunner. "Freeze glitches are useful for getting max combos in training mode."

Friendly Fire- An in-game rule setting. When turned on, your attacks damage your teammates as well as your opponents. It is standard to turn this on in tournament 2 vs. 2 matches. “They had to reset the match, since friendly fire is off by default.”

Grab/Throw- Every character can grab with Z or L/R + A/Z. Hit A or Z while holding an opponent to do a grab attack. A grab attack is an attack that does little damage. It can only be performed while holding an opponent. You tilt the control stick in a direction to hurl them in one of four directions. You can break out of a grab faster by moving the control stick around quickly. Since the C-stick serves as a shortcut to the control stick + A, you can use both sticks together to escape more quickly. If you grab while dashing, you do a dash grab, which usually has a different animation and different startup and lag from a standing grab. “I swear he grabbed me 50 times in that match. I had no idea Marth’s grab range was that long.”

High jump glitch- If a character, moving upwards from a normal/double/up-b/screw attack jump gets hit by either Mario's or Dr. Mario's cape attack, they will go almost twice as high as normal. Mewtwo's Disable attack has a similar effect on certain up-b's, such as Pikachu's. “He tried to cape my recovery, but, since I was Samus, it only ended up helping thanks to the high jump glitch.” 

Hitbox- When a character does an attack, the hitbox is what determines how wide a range the attack covers. It's called a hitbox despite not being shaped like a box for most attacks. The term hitbox is also used to describe the area of a character that can be damaged by attacks. See disjointed hitbox. “Bowser’s Whirling Fortress has an enormous hitbox.”

Invincibility frames- Certain moves and tactics give a character temporary invincibility. Both shines, Bowser’s up-B, Pichu’s d-smash, and some others give their users invincibility for a frame or few. Grabbing the edge, teching, rolling, walljumping, and getting up also do as well. See frame. “I’m not sure how he managed to dodge my f-smash; I guess he just got lucky with the invincibility frames of Doc’s up-B.”

Jacket- An extension of the Yo-yo glitch.

John- Slang: an excuse for losing, getting hit, failing a recovery, or any other unfavorable event that occurs in-game. Often when a player makes a john, other players will respond "No johns." The term was reputedly coined by Rob Money after his friend John, who would always make excuses. “He made more johns than I thought possible out of one n00b after our money match.”

Juggle- Keeping the opponent up in the air by using ground attacks or air attacks that send the opponent on an upwards trajectory. Basically, you are continually keeping them from hitting the ground by attacking them repeatedly. “Fox’s u-air juggles well, but it shouldn’t hit more than twice with good DI from the opponent.”

Jump-cancel- While dashing, if you jump and then attack or grab during the jumping animation, you can stop the dash immediately and then attack. For example, if you run forward and then hit up+A simultaneously, you will do an up-smash instead of a jump and a u-air. Jump-canceling grabs allows you to execute standing grabs while moving. Also used to describe jumping out of Falco/Fox's shine or the shield (Yoshi cannot do the latter). Commonly used to cancel the lag from the taking down of the shine/shield. Abbreviated as JC in both cases. “I was playing Falco, and my opponent was Fox. On the third stock, I shielded his jump-canceled u-smash and JC wavedashed into a shine combo.”

JV n-stock- If you have x stocks remaining, with no damage, when your opponent is defeated in a 1 vs. 1 match, it’s referred to as an JV (x+1)-stock. Coined by the pro JV4X4. See also n-stock. “Ken’s JV 5-stock was ruined after his opponent countered the final d-air of a Ken combo.”

Ken combo- As Marth, a combo of several f-airs into a d-air spike. Named after pro smasher Ken. See combo. “While not the flashiest or most damaging of combos, the Ken Combo has gained a sort of notoriety in the Smash community, and is likely to be greeted by shouts of “KEN COMBO!” from bystanders when executed.”

Knockback- Refers to how far a character is sent after being hit by an attack. It’s usually used in reference to an attack. "The knockback of Yoshi's d-tilt doesn’t vary based on the opponent's percentage".

L-cancel- When L, R, or Z is pressed before you hit the ground, the normal recovery time after an aerial attack is decreased. This works for N-air attacks only. For example, Link's aerial down-A L-cancelled will result in his pulling the sword out of the ground faster. Keep in mind that L-canceling doesn’t get rid of the lag, it just reduces it. L-canceling plays a key part in shffling and most combos. Certain aerial moves cannot be L-cancelled. See lag. “He consistently missed l-cancels, and was punished throughout the tournament.”

Lag (also called recovery time) - When a character executes an attack, there is a certain amount of time after the attack is over in which that the character cannot move. This is called lag time. Moves that are "laggy" carry an large amount of lag time. Some examples are Ganondorf's ground forward-B when it misses, and Link's aerial down-A not L-cancelled. See L-cancel, startup. “Pikachu’s aerials have more landing lag than Pichu’s.”

Ledge cancel - By landing at the edge of a platform with momentum going away, you can cancel any kind of lag, as your character will land, then fall off the platform. “Ledge canceling is common in SSB Board the Platform strategies, since most platforms can’t be fallen through.” 

Light Shield- Holding L or R lightly or Z brings up a bigger but weaker shield. It prevents shield-stabbing and is great for guarding against weak attacks. When used by holding the Z button, light shielding is called Z-shielding (the only difference is the name). See shield. “She can light shield more consistently than anyone I know. Pillaring has little effect against her Jigglypuff.”

Meteor Smash/ Meteor Spike- A meteor is a spike that can be meteor-cancelled. Most send the opponent straight down. This includes most spikes. See spike, meteor-cancel. “Meteor smashes are good for edgeguarding, but they can also be used while the opponent is on the ground as combo set-ups. The opponent will pop up into the air.”

Meteor-cancel- Jumping out of an opponent's meteor. If you double jump or up-b immediately after being hit by a meteor smash you can cancel the momentum from the meteor smash. “He meteor-canceled repeatedly, until his opponent got pissed off and just kneed him off the side.”

Mindgames- There are two senses in which this can be used. The first describes actions taken by a player that surprise his or her opponent, usually through unorthodox movement or sub-optimal strategy. The second describes the thought process of a player throughout a match; players that think on a significantly higher level than their opponents in terms of predictions, counters, and strategies, are said to have better mindgames. Both definitions are intertwined in many ways. "Aniki has insane mindgames; he uses Link and Samus and doesn't wavedash, yet he still manages to place well in tournaments."

Money match- a match played with a set monetary bet on the side. “I wonder how much Isai makes off of money matches?”

Moonwalk- Moonwalking can be performed by many characters, but the most effective moonwalker is Captain Falcon. To moonwalk, dash in a direction and quickly do a half circle rotation back (during which you should be pressing down at some point). The character will dash forward, then slide back while still doing their dashing animation. “Silent Spectre popularized the moonwalk, and it has now become a popular mix-up tactic for CF players.”

No-ping hit- Hitting with the handle of a home-run bat, so that it does not make the distinctive "ping" sound. Sends the target at a higher trajectory than a tipper. No-ping hits go further than tippers, up to a certain percentage. See tipper. “I was on record pace, but got an aerial forward no-ping instead of the tipper I wanted.”

Phantom Hit- Describes the glitch where an attack hits but doesn't move the opponent and only does half of the normal amount of damage. Occurs when the opponent is hit by the very edge of a hitbox. “Phantom rests are one of the most hilarious things that can happen in a match; that is, until you get one in a tournament.”

Pillar- Two forms of this concept have arisen over the years. The first, its formal definition, involves a Falco player chipping away at an opponents’ shield by alternating between shuffled d-airs and his shine attack. The second, more commonly used definition is the actual shine to d-air combo where the opponent receives damage. It is also used, rarely, to refer to similar tactics as Fox. “His pillaring’s pretty good, but his edgeguarding isn’t much. He’s not very good at punishing mistakes.”

Powershielding- Shielding when a projectile or thrown item is inside the range of the shield. This will result in a white flash and the attack not hitting you or weakening the shield. This causes projectiles to be reflected. “Powershielding Falco’s lasers has apparently become pretty common, as they are rather predictable.”

Priority- What the chances are of an attack taking precedence over another attack if they collide with each other. It is under dispute whether priority is an actual programmed quality of an attack or simply based on hitboxes, spacing, and timing. “Grabs have priority over every other attack in the game.”

Repetitive Move Transmutation- When any move is used repeatedly, the strength and knockback of that move will gradually go down. It can be brought to normal strength by using other moves and/or dying. SSkeeto's term. “I’ve come up with a new HRC NBA strat for Falco that takes into account Repetitive Move Transmutation.”

Rising Pound- Jiggypuff’s forward-B, Pound, can give horizontal distance with almost no loss in vertical height. To perform it, do the pound, then slide the control stick upward. Often used for recovery purposes. Banned in most tournaments as a stalling method, but allowed for recovery. “The Fox u-aired him while he was trying to recover with a Rising Pound.”

Roll- A moving dodge done by tapping the joystick to the left or right while pressing L or R. The roller is invincible for most, but not all, of the roll. Lag, startup, duration, and distance vary by character. “Mewtwo has the longest roll in the game.”

Sex Kick- This term refers to any neutral N-air kick that does damage after the actual movement of the foot is over. The attack gets weaker and has less knock back the longer it is out. The only exception is Dr. Mario. His sex kick attack actually gets stronger, and has more knock back the longer it is out. Fox and Falco's aerial backwards A is also considered a sex kick. The "sex" affixation can also be used for swords, chairs, etc... "Samus's sex kick is one of the best n-airs in the game: it's great for disrupting combos and edgeguarding."

Shffl- See the section on shffls below.

Shield- Holding R or L will cause the character to put up a circular shield around their body. The character is immune from most attacks while the shield is up. The shield naturally shrinks over time, and hitting it will shrink it further. If a shield is completely destroyed, the shielding character will experience an enormous amount of stun, essentially giving their opponent a free hit. Jigglypuff will fly upwards if her shield breaks and die if there is no solid object above her. Yoshi's shield looks like an egg, and completely surrounds him regardless of how much it is weakened. By lightly tilting the control stick, one can move the shield around to provide more protection against shield-stab in certain areas. See the terms below for more details, as well as light shield and jump-canceling. "He sat there and shielded my projectiles, but I stayed patient and eventually he had to try to approach."

Shield grab- Hitting A or Z while shielding will allow you to grab the opponent out of a shield. An essential tactic for countering overaggressive opponents. Note that it is sometimes possible to hit a shieldgrabber before the grab comes out. "Isai is notorious for being able to shield-grab almost any approach."

Shield-stab- Attacking a shielded opponent where the shield's leaving a part of the character vulnerable, allowing them to bypass the shield's defense. This gets easier to do as your opponent's shield gets smaller. "One of Jigglypuff's few advantages against Marth is her near-invulnerability to shield-stabs, which are a Marth specialty."

Shield stun- When an attack is shielded, there is a brief period of time during which the shielder cannot do anything. The amount of lag time depends on the move used. "The developers of Melee had to tone down shield stun from the original SSB, in which you could repeatedly attack a shielding opponent and break their shield without letting them react."

Shine- Another name for Fox's and Falco's reflector (down-b). "Many people consider Fox's shine the best move in the game."

Shine-spike- The term for spiking someone using Fox's reflector. Because Fox's reflector sends people down, is instantaneous, and has invincibility frames, it is a very useful method for edge-guarding. See spike. "Zelgadis became infamous for his shinespikes after his video 'Shined Blind' was released."

Short hop- While running or standing, pressing a jump button or up on the control stick for a shorter time than usual will result in a shorter first jump. Abbreviated as SH. "Luigi's combos often involve maneuvering with short-hopped aerials."

Short Hop Laser/Blaster- With Fox or Falco, short jumping followed by a laser and a fastfall is considered a Short Hop Laser, or SHL (sometimes Short Hop Blaster, or SHB). Doing this greatly reduces the lag on the laser. If the B button is pressed soon enough, Fox can do a Short Hop Double Laser, or SHDL. "Falco's approach revolves around his SHL, while Fox's is mainly used to tack on damage to too-slow or inagressive foes."

Shorthopped wavedashed- short hop, execute an attack, then waveland. http://www.freewebs.com/tobiasxk/screwshffls.html 
gives a fuller explanation. Abbreviated as SHWD. Note that this is a misnomer, and the tactic should technically be called the shorthop waveland. See short hop. "SHWDs are most useful as Luigi, but can also be used by other characters, like Mario and Marth."

Slip-off- See ledge-cancel.

Spamming- Continuously and persistently using the same attack. Often looked down upon, sometimes sardonically, by the Smash community. Often used in reference to projectile attacks. "Doc's pill spam is annoyingly hard for some characters to get through, so you should be patient when confronted with such a player."

Spike- Any attack that sends an enemy at a downward angle in the air (usually less than 45 degrees away from straight down). Many spikes are a character's aerial down-A. Many spike attacks are meteor smashes, although it is generally best to use the two as distinct sets. See meteor smash. "The so-called 'Ken Combo' consists of multiple f-airs into a d-air spike."

Spot dodge- Also known as side-stepping, spot dodging is pressing down while shielding to dodge/side-step an attack. You can also press down on the C-stick to spot dodge. Lag, startup, and duration vary by character. "Wes is famous for his tactic of alternating Samus' neutral-A and spot dodge very rapidly to confuse the opponent."

Startup- How long an attack takes to start. Attacks with high startup time include Falcon Punch (C. Falcon's B) and Ganondorf's Warlock Punch (B) / Volcano Kick (tilt up-A). Attacks with low startup time include Fox/Falco's reflector (down-B), Ganondorf's neutral-A, and Jigglypuff's Rest. See also lag. "Sheik's u-smash has excellent knockback, but its startup holds it back from being a very effective KO move."

Super Jump- Catching Link's or Young Link's boomerang while hanging from a hookshot (See wall-grapple) will result in a very high jump. This glitch works only in NTSC version 1.0. Other characters have glitches that cause abnormally high jumps as well, including Samus and Pikachu. "The super jump can lead to some weird glitches in itself, like getting stuck to the ceiling or throwing people through the floor."

Super Wave Dash- An extremely long wavedash executable by Samus. Essentially what needs to be done is to press both horizontal directions very quickly when Samus is in her Morph Ball mode after a Bomb and near the ground. This requires single-frame reaction/luck. The term is abbreviated SWD. Thanks to Darknut2627 for the definition. Refer to http://www.smashboards.com/showthread.php?t=55424 for the full, in-depth insanity. "He can SWD pretty reliably, and uses it for everything; approaches, combos, edgehogging, you name it. Unfortunately, his mindgames aren't much."

Sweetspot- Any part of an attack that does more damage, or has a better effect than other parts of the same attack. For example, if Marth hits someone with the very tip of his sword, it will do more damage and send him or her back farther. Sweetspotting also describes the act of putting as little of your character above the ledge as possible during a recovery while still grabbing it, as a countermeasure against certain edgeguards. See Tipper. "The sweetspot of most of Mewtwo's tail attacks lies near the middle of his tail."

Taunt- Press up on the directional pad and your character will taunt the opponent. This is a purely graphical effect, except as Luigi, who can hit the opponent with his taunt, and Mario, whose taunt enlarges his hitbox. Pichu has two taunts; which occurs depends on which direction Pichu is facing. Fox and Falco each have a special taunt that can be performed once-per-match and only on Corneria and Venom, respectively. You must press up on the D-pad for exactly one frame (1/60 of a second). If you are having trouble with that you can try repeatedly pressing left and right on the d-pad. Basically, all that happens is the Starfox team appears and makes some random comments or fires at the enemy. "Getting Tauntspiked by Luigi is one of the most embarrassing things that can happen to a smasher."

Tech- When you are tumbling in the air after being hit, you can press L, R, or Z near the ground or a wall/ceiling, with or without a direction, to recover faster than usual. Holding left or right on a ground tech will result in a roll in the direction. You will then be falling normally, as if you had just jumped up, and will be able to perform attacks. If you hold up on the control stick while teching off a wall, your character will jump off the wall, similar to a walljump. This is sometimes called the techjump. Techchasing refers to a tactic wherein a player will attempt to predict where their opponent will tech or roll and follow them there with an attack or grab. "He missed techs consistently, and as Marth, it wasn't that hard to punish him."

Tilt attack- Holding any one of the four control stick directions, and hitting A. Some left/right tilt attacks can be aimed diagonally. Called the "strong attack" in-game. "Sheik's tilts are all excellent for comboing, and set up into her f-air well."

Tipper- Hitting with the tip of the home-run bat. Sends target much farther horizontally than a non-tipper. In addition to the meaning mentioned above, "tipper" is used as another name for hitting with the optimal range of any of Marth's attacks, said range being any range where there is distinct damage and knock back (the tip). Thanks to MaskedMarth for additional information on this term. See no-ping hit, sweet spot. "The sandbag was at record damage, but somehow I got a no-ping hit instead of an aerial tipper."

Triangle jumping- A tactic wherein you jump, then air dodge diagonally into the ground. Very similar to wavedashing, except that the air dodge occurs after the character leaves the ground, rather than before. See the section below on wavedashing. "Triangle jumping looks kind of weird and can be used to psych out the opponent at times."

Up-B Cancel- Doctor Mario can actually cancel his Up-B. After you press Up B (Up and to the Right preferably), to cancel it, quickly tap in the opposite control stick direction. If you succeed it will be very noticeable- the coin jump sound is made, but Dr. Mario will stay on the ground, just keep practicing because this is one of those things that will take time to master. 1-frame reaction time is required, though. Credit to AlphaZealot from SWF “I’d never seen anyone use the up-b cancel to edgeguard before he did.”

Upward Pound- A tactic with Jigglypuff where you use Pound, and then quickly press up so Jigglypuff pounds in a more upward direction. This helps horizontal recovery. Repeated Upward Pounds can be used to recover or stall, but using them to stall is banned in most tournaments. You can also do it downwards. "Apparently my opponent thought using the Upward Pound to recover was banned, and wouldn't believe me until I fetched the tournament coordinator. What a scrub." 

Wallbombing- Using the Peach Bomber attack (forward+B) as a smash attack makes Peach pop up a little bit with just a little lag, allowing her to use it repeatedly to gain height. If kept up for long enough, this can be used to stall out time matches, though using it to stall is banned. "It's legal to wallbomb to recover, but I've never seen anyone do it in a tournament. Why is that?"

Wall-grapple- With Link, Young Link, or Samus, hit R/L+A or Z in the air and near a wall (facing the wall of course) to latch onto it. Hit A while hanging, or after the initial latching to climb the grappling device. Can only be used once per time in the air (you have to land before you can use it again), but you can use the character's ^B after using a wall-grapple. What most players will do is air-dodge upwards and then hit Z, immediately followed by pressing A/Z again to launch them upwards. "Using their grapples and walljumps, Samus and Young Link can recover from the very bottom of Fountain of Dreams, off the small pillar."

Wall-jump- Hitting the opposite direction when your character is near a wall, and not tumbling, will cause them to jump off the wall upwards and away from it. Works only with Mario, Samus, Young Link, Fox, Sheik, Falco, Pichu, and Captain Falcon. If any character not listed here seemed to have wall-jumped, you probably just witnessed him tech-jumping (see teching). Mario is a special case because he can wall-jump after his up-b. See also tech. "Nearly all characters who can walljump use it in their BtT strategies, just because of how flexible and acrobatic it is."

Wall of Pain- The use of aerials while weaving in and out of your opponent's attack range to create a "wall" of priority. It almost always refers to the use of Jigglypuff's aerials, particularly the b-air. This is most easily done by using the c-stick to use the desired aerial attack and using the joystick to weave in and out of your opponent's attack range. Can be used with other characters such as Kirby with his b-air. Abbreviated as WoP. "He WoPed for about a minute, then floated towards me and rested. I got lucky, since I had no idea that was coming, but I had Countered right before that anyway."

Wallshining- Fox can perform his infinite combo against a wall to make it easier. See Fox's infinite combo.

Walltech- See tech.

Wavedash- See the section below on wavedashing.

Waveland- If a character in the air does a downward diagonal airdodge while near the ground, they will slide along it in a manner similar to the wavedash. "Wavelands aren't used much in combos, but they help with spacing and movement."

WaveX- Doing action X while wavedashing. One example is the wavesmash. "Marth's grab game is only helped by his long wavedash; his wavegrabs are fast and often hard to see coming."

Wobbling- An infinite hold by the Ice Climbers. Grab with the main character (default=Popo) and hold down on the control stick as you're doing the grab. Keep hitting the A button, so that Popo does his grab attack, and Nana (the other IC) does her D-tilt. If done correctly, the other player should not be able to escape. Recently named for the first player to do it reliably in a tournament, Wobbles the Phoenix. “After Wobbles won Evo South 2007 mainly through wobbling, a bit of controversy arose over whether the tactic was “broken”- however, wobbling has not yet begun to dominate the competitive scene, so the answer is probably no.”

Yo-yo glitch- A glitch wherein Ness sets a hitbox on the ground that allows him to hit opponents with attacks that would not normally hit them, as well as do many other weird things. Popularized by Simna ibn Sind. “Yo-yo glitches aren’t always helpful in 1 vs. 1 matches, but in teams they can be deadly.” See http://www.smashboards.com/showthread.php?t=48717

?-air, ?-tilt, ?-smash, ?-throw, etc.- refers to aerial A attacks, tilts, smashes, throws, and sometimes other actions in the four directions and neutral (for aerials). Replace ? with n (neutral), u (up), f (forward), b (back), or d (down) to signify which. n-air = neutral aerial A, f-tilt = forward tilt, etc. A?A is also used less commonly as an abbreviation for Aerial ? A; it's usually used in Home Run Contest strategies. 

n-stock- If you have x stocks remaining when you defeat your opponent, it’s known as an x-stock. 4-stocks are considered the ultimate beating in tournament matches, as each player only starts with 4 lives. See also JV n-stock. “I had to face Azen in the first round, and I got 4-stocked twice.”

WAVEDASHING

Wavedashing is so special its gets a section all to itself. Funny thing is, all I’m going to do is direct you to another site that has an in-depth essay on Wavedashing and post a list. The term “wavedash” was originally coined for a similar tactic in Tekken.

http://www.freewebs.com/tobiasxk/wavedashing.html 

Every character’s wavedash goes a different length. It all depends on how much traction they have. The characters are in order from longest to shortest wavedash here: 

Luigi 
Ice Climbers 
Mewtwo 
Marth 
Yoshi 
Roy 
Dr. Mario / Mario / Mr. Game & Watch 
Samus 
Ness 
Fox 
Bowser 
Falco 
Young Link 
Ganondorf 
DK 
Pikachu / Sheik 
Captain Falcon / Kirby 
Pichu 
Jigglypuff 
Link 
Peach / Zelda

SHFFL

The SHFFL (rarely, SHFFLC; sometimes incorrectly called "shuffle") is also quite special. For this term Warrior of Zarona sent me (mastersword) his essay on shffling. 

For those who don't know, shffl stands for the following: 

sh = short hop = Tap your jump button and release before your character leaves the ground. S/he will only hop at a quarter to half of his/her normal jump. 
ff = fastfall = Smash down on your control stick at the peak of a character's jump. Forces your character to fall faster to the ground. 
l = l-cancel = Press L/R when landing from an aerial attack using the A button. Tremendously reduces lag from a character's landing animation. 

Pronounced "shuffle." 

First of all, shffl attacks are the quickest and the most efficient way of attacking your enemy. In a simple way of explaining how shffl attacks work, it allows a character to use aerial attacks as if they were on the ground. But one would ask, why not just use ground attacks? 

Because ground attacks are limited, usually laggier, and forces you to stand still while using them, ycz6 note: Actually, you can wavedash into them, but he's making a point as opposed to shffl attacks, where you can control and move in the direction you want to attack, and L-cancel drastically lets your character move faster after each attack. The only exception you have for a ground attack is a dash attack, and even then, it's inferior to a shffl attack in that you have to deal with the lag at the end of the attack. It's also easily counterable. 

As for the shffl itself, what makes it so effective? Let's take it apart piece by piece here. 

First, what you want to do is a short hop, which helps you use your aerial attack at a range where you can still make contact against your opponent on the ground.
Your attack comes next. Your options are basically all the aerial attacks that you can use: N-air, F-Air, B-air, U-Air, and D-air. Each of the first letters corresponds to the direction of your attack, with N being neutral. Generally, you'd want to use your attack right when you hop off the ground, but sometimes, it's situational. If I hop and I find myself initially out of range, I keep moving forward and attack when I reach my opponent, skipping the fastfall all together. Anyway, let's not complicate things: learn to attack right from the short hop.

Then you'd want to fastfall when you're at the peak or while you're descending. The point of the fastfall is so you can land on the ground as quickly as you can, which is where the L-cancel comes in. Try practicing this in conjunction with the short hop, first without attacks, and then with.

Finally, the L-cancel. The easiest way to tell the difference whether or not you're doing it right is with Link's D-Air. Without L-cancel, Link usually takes a painful long time to take his sword out of the ground. With it, you'll see the quickened pace. In competitive/advanced play, when you learn what you want to do next and instinctively train yourself to use that action after you L-cancel, you'll realize how much of a difference it'll make on your gameplay when you do or don't L-cancel. 

For example, if you're using Fox and plan to shine after L-canceling, you'll find that not being able to L-cancel leaves you open for a few good frames, long enough for someone to grab you or jump out of the way before you can use the shine. 

So what do we get without any of these components? Without a short hop, you won't be able to attack with your aerials close to the ground. Without a fastfall, you'll find yourself hanging in the air longer then you want to. Without an L-cancel, you'll find that you're not moving as quickly as you should be, and the few frames that it takes for the animation to end could cost you the match. 

Practice with characters that are easier to short hop with. Bowser and Ganondorf normally make good choices. Use N-air, F-air, and B-air first. Next, try attempting a D-air and then the U-air, which are normally the more difficult to use out of the 5 aerial attacks. If you want, you can learn to shffl your attacks using the C-stick. I've been using C-Stick up to use a shffl U-air with Fox, but quite recently, I'm getting better at using it with just the control stick. 

Eventually, you'll want to move on step by step to characters that are more difficult to short hop with, like Link or Mario. Then move on to Fox and Falco. Etc. etc. 

Also, study each character and realize that shffl attacks aren't useful for every single character out there, or that there can be some exceptions. For example, rarely do I see a Peach use a shffl attack since she has better options, but Fox uses it quite constantly. A Samus player normally wouldn't shffl unless it was out of a bomb jump. Some players don't fastfall Captain Falcon's n-air in a shffl to allow both kicks to hit. Learn these things about every individual character. 

As you study more, you can start learning about hit boxes and priority. Hopefully, you, as a player who might be pursuing a higher level of play, will be able to understand these concepts and be able to practice shffling. Good luck, smasher, and practice as hard as you can.

DIRECTIONAL INFLUENCE

Doraki's SWF thread contains a lot of good information, and explains all of the below in more detail: http://smashboards.com/showthread.php?t=60218

A lot of people under-estimate DI. To solve that problem, we have XiF:

Basically, DI is influencing your flight pattern from an attack inflicted upon you, or any aerial movement. DI is most effective in escaping combos, and surviving to higher percents. There are many types of DI, I'll go from the worst kind, to the best.

No DI: Just how it sounds, you don’t influence your movement at all. Very bad for shine combo's, chaingrabs, staying alive, etc. In very rare cases it will be somewhat useful. Like, not DI'ing so you mind game your chain grabber. DI'ing outwards from characters like Marth is bad too, cause it may set up for a tipper. Or even DI'ing may set you up for one depending. But in reality, you don’t want to do this DI.

Simple control stick DI: before and during you get hit, you hold a direction and don’t let go so you change your flight pattern. This is good for escaping some shine and chain grab combos, and staying alive in general. But if you want to live to like 160%, this isn’t going to cut it. There are other, better ways.

Double stick DI: this is extremely interesting, and it astounded me when I first saw it. You can actually DI with both the control stick and the c stick. You can pull off 2 different DI's at once, allowing you to greatly influence your flight trajectory. We were testing it with peach's F-throw. We were able to survive an f throw right near the right edge of Final Destination to about 196% and still live. One certain pair of directions made this (I think it was n up left, and left). But other ones made some pretty weird flight patterns. An up left on control stick and left down on the c stick caused the fox to actually go straight up from the U-throw. Very... very interesting.

Anyway, I hope this kind of sheds light on those who kind of consider DI to be unimportant. 

Recent research has revealed another type.
Smash DI: Each attack has a certain hitstun period. Those of Samus's B and Peach's f-throw are notably long. During these periods, the effects of DI are greatly magnified: any directional presses during these periods have very noticeable effects on the trajectory of the hit character. For example, for his video Perfect Control SuperDoodleMan was able, as Mario, to take a fully-charged Charge Shot from Samus and fly towards her.

TIERS

Rather than explaining this myself, I'm going to give you a link to another site that has an in-depth essay on tiers. I will, however, show you the current tier list and add a bit of info. 

http://www.freewebs.com/xiffer/tiers.html 

The tier list is a ranking of the characters in SSBM. The tier list is determined by members of the Smash World Forums' Smash Back Room, and changes every now and then. The tier list applies only under tournament conditions and only to the top levels of the Smash community.

TOURNAMENT LEGAL SETTINGS

General rule sets follow most of these rules:


4 stock, with time, minutes doubling stock, items off.

Banned stages vary, but often include Hyrule Temple, Yoshi's Island 64, and Brinstar Depths, Infinite Mountain, Big Blue, and Termina, which are always off (and can't be chosen, even under slob picks). Stages set on random also vary, but often include Final Destination, Battlefield, Dreamland, Fountain of Dreams, and Pokemon Stadium. These stages often vary between 1 vs. 1 and 2 vs. 2 matches at the same tournament. See this picture made by phanna for a helpful visual reference:

Before the match, each side may "strike" one stage, making that stage unplayable for the duration of the set.

The "slob pick" method of choosing stages is usually used in tournaments. The first stage is chosen from the set of random stages, unless both sides agree on a stage.

After the first match, the loser picks the stage by the following method. First, the loser announces his stage choice. Then the winner picks character(s) and then the loser picks character(s).

Team attack is on, and no stage can be played twice in the same set. The tier list is based on these rules, and these only, with rational human players.

Under no other circumstances should it be applied.
Phanna has made a pictoral guide to the tournament stage settings: http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/8236/mlgstagesphannauj4.jpg

Note, though, that this may be outdated.

EVERYBODY asks about videos. Where can I find this, where can I see that. Blah Blah Blah. So, to solve that problem, here is a huge video section with links. The list has changed since last time. Do not be fooled. Gaming Freak went through and checked EVERY SINGLE LINK to make sure that they work. (ycz6 edit: Of course, this happened about two years ago. So you know what? I did it again. Hurray for me. I deleted most anyway.) In addition, if you can’t find what you are looking for here, check DC++. If you don’t know what DC++ is, well, there’s a section for it too later on.

5 frames - Captain Falcon / Dr. Mario / Luigi / Mario / Marth / Mr. Game & Watch / Ness / Young Link
6 frames - DK / Falco / Jigglypuff / Mewtwo / Peach / Roy / Yoshi
7 frames - Ganondorf / Link / Zelda
9 frames – Bowser

CLONES

SSBM has several pairs of characters that are very similar to each other, particularly in their move animations. I called on the people of Gamefaqs to help me here. They worked together to compile a long list of comparisons for each and every pair of clones. I gave credit to everybody under the list they helped with. The damage ranges are due to the effects of repetitive move transmutation.

Note that individual moves are compared based solely on how much damage they do. It is entirely possible and often true that a move that does less damage is more useful than one that does more.

Fox vs. Falco

Wavedash length: Fox's is longer.
Running speed: Fox is faster.
Taunt length: Fox's is shorter (4 frames so not that much of a difference)
Falco falls faster than Fox, although the acceleration of Fox's fall is higher.
Falco jumps higher.
Fox can foxtrot to go faster than his normal dash.
Fox's up B goes farther than Falco's.
Fox's blaster shoots faster, but doesn't stun.
Falco's blaster shoots more slowly, but does stun.
Fox can Short-Hop Double Laser (SHDL) while Falco can only Short-Hop Laser (SHL).
Falco's D-tilt and F-smash have more KO ability.
Fox's U-smash and u-air have more KO potential.
Falco's d-air is a spike (not a meteor smash) while Fox has a drill kick.
Fox can shine-spike.
Falco's reflector's knock back depends on the damage the opponent has, while Fox's is a set distance that depends on traction.
Fox has infinite combos.

Falco's SHL is useful as a pressure game, approach, retreat, and even as hits between combos. The laser is disruptive and the damage is decent. His u-tilt juggles better, meaning that that becomes essential in little combos and whatnot. His f-air gets more used because of its knock back so shffled f-airs aren't uncommon. He'll get kills through F-smash, b-air, or d-air spikes...maybe u-air, I suppose. His shine combos involve jump-canceling the shine or waveshining into an aerial, as it sends opponents upwards where they are in perfect position for a spike back to the ground where the process can be repeated, or another attack depending on DI and whatnot. His recovery also sucks a bit.

Fox's SHL is somewhat useful, but without the stun/knock back of Falco's, it's not disruptive and just tacks on little bits of damage. It can be doubled in a short hop, however, for whatever that's worth... just doubling the damage, really. The set knock back on his shine gives him a very different type for his Shine combos, and also allows for low-percentage kills with shine-spiking (See shine-spike in the terms section). His shine combos utilize the set knock back of the shine to form combos such as waveshining into a follow up, or even continuing with more waveshines or drillkick waveshines. This allows him flatland infinite combos AND infinites against walls, where he just doesn't have to move forward. His U-smash and u-air are killers. Fox's kills tend to be vert kills or shinespike kills. Shffled sex kicks get used more than f-airs with him, contrary to Falco. 

Where Falco's game revolves around SHL to control the stage and shine-aerial combos, along with chained f-airs and side kills or d-air spikes, Fox focuses more on the sexkicks, drillshines and waveshine combos, shine spikes and vert kills.

Dr. Mario vs. Luigi vs. Mario

Weight: All three weigh the same.
Wavedash length: (Doc/Mario)same, but Luigi’s is the longest.
Running speed: not a noticeable difference(Doc/Mario not sure about Luigi).
Taunt length: Mario’s is obviously the longest (not sure about Doc/Luigi), Luigi's is damaging.
Luigi is floatier than either of the other two- as a result, he can do two aerials in one short hop without much difficulty.
Mario's f-air is a meteor smash, Doc and Luigi’s f-air aren't.
Doc's b-air has somewhat of a downward trajectory, and can be considered a semi-spike.
Mario’s A,A,A ground attack is faster than Doc’s. Luigi's is comparable to Mario's.
Luigi’s D-smash and n-air send the opponent up.
Mario's F-smash is fire and does weak damage if it's only Mario's hand that hits the opponent rather than the fire; Doc's electric glove F-smash doesn't need a sweetspot but thus has less range; Luigi's F-smash also has no sweetspot, but has less range than either of the others.
Mario can wall jump; Doc and Luigi can't.
Doc is the oddball in sex kicks; it's stronger the longer it's out.
Doc's cape doesn't help much in recovery.
The pills travel at a lower angle than Mario's fireballs. Luigi's fireballs travel horizontally. Mario's Fireballs go further than vitamins, which go further than Luigi's fireballs.
The Mario Tornado has hitboxes on the sides of his head at the fist, but the last hit is around his body. The Dr. Tornado has the same hitbox for the 1st hit (the rest are full-body). It also doesn't send him up quite as high and has a random trajectory angle. The Luigi Cyclone hits each character only once during the spinning portion and once at the end, and hits them upward in both cases.
Mario and Dr. Mario's moves have the same amount of frames. Their grabs actually look different, though.
Mario's Cape reaches outward more and ends up covering his whole front side and the top. Dr. Mario's Sheet hits a large area in front of him and ends up covering his whole body.

Ganondorf vs. Captain Falcon

Wavedash length: Ganondorf’s is longer
Running speed: Captain Falcon is faster
Taunt length: Captain Falcon’s is shorter
Ganondorf’s aerial down B spikes, while Captain Falcon’s has an upward trajectory.
Ganondorf’s B has a longer start up lag and is stronger.
Captain Falcon’s f-air is strongest at the beginning of the animation and is sex-kick like.
Captain Falcon falls faster. Ganondorf is heavier.
Captain Falcon has a natural combo with his A,A,A, while Ganondorf doesn’t.
Captain Falcon has 3 hitboxes on his B move: 27% close, 25% mid, 23% tip. Ganon has one.
Falcon's u-tilt has a half second start-up time; Ganon's has the longest set startup time of any move in the game but is very powerful (not enough to make it worth using, though)

Pikachu vs. Pichu

Both have the same terminal velocity. 
Pikachu is slightly faster than Pichu. 
Pichu is lighter than Pikachu. 
Pichu is smaller. 
Pichu can walljump. 
Pichu's roll is longer than Pikachu's. 
Pikachu's wavedash is longer than Pichu's. 
Pikachu is slightly faster while running. 
Pichu's up-B does 1% and then 3% to himself, goes slower and not as far, doesn't damage the opponent, and doesn't give him invincibility like Pikachu's does. Pikachu has more landing lag. Pichu's forward-B can charge up to 39% damage and goes further fully charged. Pikachu's takes less time to charge but does a maximum of 29% damage.
Pikachu's thunder hits foes away; Pichu's hits multiple times, sending them upward. Pikachu's thunder has fewer hits to it than Pichu's, but each does more damage and has greater knockback. Pikachu's thunder will travel past him in the air should the thunder not connect with him, but Pichu's fails to go a certain distance below Pichu. 
Pichu hurts himself with all his B attacks (his down B will only hurt him if the thunder bolt actually makes contact with him), his f-smash, his d-air and f-air, his grab attack, and his F-throw. 
Pikachu's d-smash is multiple hit, and launches the opponent. Pichu's is a single hit and sends the opponent horizontally, and in the opposite direction of that which Pichu is facing. They do equal damage.
Pikachu's f-smash has more range, and is a single hit. Pichu's is a multiple hit, with high initial knockback in the last hit. 
Pikachu's u-smash is a full body twirl, which focuses ahead of him, barely affecting those behind him. Pichu's is a headsmash, which affects enemies on both sides equally. Pikachu’s is much stronger when sweetspotted.
Pikachu's u-air can hit it any direction depending on the timing and the position of the opponent. Pichu's always hits upward. Pikachu's has a larger hitbox.
Both taunts can be cancelled by any attack or their shield a few frames before they normally would. 
Pichu has two variations of taunt, depending on whether he's facing left or right.
Pikachu has more lag on his aerials than Pichu, all of them. 
And.. um.. for the record, Pichu flies higher when his shield breaks.

VERSIONS

This game currently has 4 different versions, 3 NTSC and PAL. Your game’s version number is on the backside of the disk. It’s difficult to read. On one of the inner rings, there is some text that says .xx You have either 1.00, 1.01, or 1.02. The PAL version is the one sold in Europe and Australia, and does not have the numbers on the bottom. The differences between the NTSC and PAL versions are: 

Marth falls over from Fox's shine in PAL. 
Bowser, Kirby and Yoshi are heavier in PAL. 
Marth, Fox and Mario are lighter in PAL. 
Falco's d-air now only spikes for the first half of the animation. The rest sends them slightly up. 
Sheik's u-air isn't as strong in PAL. 
Marth's d-air is meteor smash, not a spike, in PAL. 
Fox's down and forward smash are less powerful in PAL. 
Yoshi's f-smash is more powerful in PAL. 
Peach's dash attack is less powerful in PAL. 
Luigi's n-air is less powerful in PAL. 
Ganon's d-air was weakened, from 22% in NTSC to 21% in PAL. 
Yoshi's d-air was weakened, from 44% in NTSC to 36% in PAL. 
DI on Sheik's d-throw has been changed so that it can no longer chain in PAL. 
Fox can tech out of Falco’s d-throw in PAL. 
Bowser's d-throw hits Mr. Game and Watch in PAL. 
Link's super jump glitch was removed in PAL. 
Samus's extended grapple beam was removed in PAL. 
The IC freeze glitch was removed in PAL. 
The Japanese language option was dropped in PAL in favor of Italian, French, Spanish and German. Jigglypuff also sings (Up+B) her name in the language Smash is set to. 
Names can now include upper and lower case letters, but there is no Japanese character set. 
In the English language setting, distances are measured in meters. 
Lag and loading times have been reduced in PAL. 
The Special Movie was removed in PAL. 

^^^ That list is from SWF and MrSilver, meaning that I take no credit for it. 

The differences between the three NTSC versions are changes such as increasing the length of HRC track from ~4.4k ft to 11347.2 ft and removing some glitches- notably, Bowser's Flame Cancel glitch and Link and Young Link's Super Jump glitch were removed from 1.0 to 1.2.

MISCELLANEOUS
You cannot increase the stamina in Stamina Mode without an Action Replay (cheating device). The only time you ever could (without cheating) was in the beta version. 

Peach can pull several different types of turnips out of the ground. In addition, she can sometimes get a Beam Sword, a Mr. Saturn, and a Bomb-omb. Here is a list of the damages each turnip does: 

Each turnip does 2% more if you use a smash throw. 
Normal smiley :)- 6% 
Circle eyes o.o - 6% 
Line eyes -.- - 6% 
Carrot eyes ^.^ - 6% 
Eyebrow eyes ~.~ - 6% 
Wink *_ ' - 10% 
Dot eyes •_• - 16% 
Stitch face =_= - 34% 
Thanks to SoyWamp and Wavedasher75 for getting this list put together. 

Marth’s taunt and victory poses translated: 

Taunt 

Says: "Minna, miteite kure!" 
Translated: "Everyone, look at me!" 

Victory Poses 
Says: "Konkai wa boku no kachi da ne?" 
Translated: "Doesn't it seem I am the victor?" 

Says: "Kyou mo ikinobiru koto ga dekita." 
Translated: "Today, I have survived." 

Says: "Boku wa makeru wake-ni wa ikanainda!" 
Translated: "There's no way I can lose." 

You can throw an Electrode towards the very end of its “I-am-slowly-getting-darker” phase. Basically when it’s a flashing brown/black, you can pick it up just like a normal item and throw it. It will still explode if it is in your hands, however. Bob-ombs can also be picked up after they stop walking and flash. 

There are 290 trophies in the US versions, and 293 trophies in the JPN versions. You can get the extra three through an AR (action replay). AR is like the Gameshark for the Gamecube. It’s a cheating device.
